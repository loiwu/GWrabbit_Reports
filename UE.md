Focus on User Experience
Colors
Icons
Real Dimensions
Fonts
Deciding on the font can be part of the wireframing process. On iOS, Helvetica Neue is the font of choice and is readily available by default on the Mac (if you’d like more history about that font, I strongly suggest watching the documentary called “Helvetica”).

How To Export Photoshop Shapes To Sketch
If you happen to have a set of icons that are exclusively made for Photoshop, the process is a bit more complicated to suck the SVG out of them. This process requires Photoshop and Illustrator:
1) In Photoshop, select all the Photoshop shape layers and Merge Shapes. 
2) Go to File > Export > Paths to Illustrator and save the file as .ai (Illustrator) 
3) In Illustrator, select all the shapes and apply a black color.
4) Go to File > Save As… and select format SVG 
5) Import the SVG file to Sketch and edit them.
